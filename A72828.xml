            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>CERTAINE RVLES,</hi> To bee obſerved <hi>In the Adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, Offered</hi> To the Privat Conſideration of thoſe that intend to pertake of that Sacrament to their comfort.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not lawfull for us in Gods worſhip to doe what wee think good in our owne eyes, but what hee doth appoint.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For if wee know not what hee doth appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>int, wee cannot worſhip him in Faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If wee worſhip him not in Faith, wee can not pleaſe him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And if wee pleaſe him not, wee can not expect his bleſſing upon our performance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Therefore to bee ſure of a bleſſing in his worſhip, wee muſt come to him in Faith, worſhipping him in Spirit and Truth: and to come thus to him, wee muſt needs know and obſerve what hee hath appointed to bee done in his worſhip.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Now to know and obſerve this in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, wee muſt conſider Chriſts Practiſe in the Inſtitution therof, ſo farre as it is imitable: and his intention in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us to imitate him therin.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The neceſſitie of conſidering Chriſts Practiſe and intention in this matter, doth ariſe from the Apoſtles commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who doth heerin very diſtinctly referre us unto Chriſt himſelf, for a warrant of that which is to bee done; Saying, that in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>hee delivered that which hee received of the Lord.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23. and that <hi>wee ought to follow him ſo farre as hee is a follower of the Lord.</hi> Ibid. v. 1.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb facs="tcp:151076:2"/>
8. Therefore wee are bound to looke unto Chriſt firſt then to the Apoſtle, becauſe finally our Faith muſt reſt only in him; for wee are ſure that in following him and fulfilling his intention wee doe nothing amiſſe.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Chriſts Practiſe then in the inſtitution of his Supper to bee imitated was this:</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt hee tooke bread, and by giving ſpeciall thankes over it, hee ſeparated it from the common to a Holy uſe: Then hee brake it, and gave it to his diſciples, and commanded them to ear therof.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, hee tooke the Cup which in like manner by a ſpeciall bleſſing, hee ſeparated from the common to a Holy uſe, and then gave it to his diſciples commanding them all to drinck of it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. This bread and Cup the Lord did diſtribute being at Table with his diſciples, and ſpeaking with them of his death and of the fruits therof. Math. 26.20, 26. Mark. 14.18, 22.10. Next to Chriſts Practiſe the Apoſtolicall Practiſe is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, which in the Primitive Church did imitate the Lord heerin: namely that all the members of the Church were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Lords table, where they did eat of the bread &amp; drinck of the Cup (both beeing bleſſed) as they uſed to doe at their meales, with a table geſture. 1 Cor. 11.33. 1 Cor. 10.16, 17, 21. 1 Cor. 11.20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Chriſts intention in this inſtitution of his Supper, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare clearly by his words, and ſome of his Actions, to have beene this.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſh that hee did purpoſe to give unto his diſciples a ſeale of his covenant, and a repreſentation of his death, and of the benefits therof exhibited in the new covenant to the worthy receiver. This is evident by the words of conſecration which hee uſeth in delivering the Elemens; which words are a promiſe of the vertue of his body &amp; blood exhibited unto his diſciples.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, that hee would have his diſciples to imitate in after tymes his practiſe in this his laſt Supper for a memoriall of him till his comming againe: This is cleer by the expreſſe words of the commandement: <hi>Doe this in Remembrance of me,</hi> Luk 22.19. &amp; by the Apoſtles explication therof, 1 Cor. 11.25, 26.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb facs="tcp:151076:2"/>
III. Thirdly, that hee would have them by this his Supper not only to bee mindfull of his death till his comming, but alſo of his comming it ſelf, and therin of their Happie eſtate with him in his Fathers Kingdome and at his table in heaven; which appeareth by the words of promiſe, which the Euangeliſts relate Chriſt annexed to the conſecration of the Cup; namely that <hi>hee would not drinke of the fruit of the vine from that tyme foreward; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that daye when hee ſhould drinke it new with them in his Fathers Kingdome,</hi> Matth. 26.29. Mark. 14.25. So then hee did make that Cup and bread wherin his body and blood was offered unto them here on earth, a pledge of the food of glory which they were to receive in heaven at the feaſt of the Lambs wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Fourthly and laſtly, it ſeemeth alſo that Chriſts inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this his laſt Supper was, to let his Diſciples know and to give them an Aſſurance of the Eſteeme which he had de of them; namely that hee counted them no more ſervants, but his freinds and familiars; Ioh. 15.15, and to expreſſe this fully and clearly to them, hee doth not only ſette them with himſelf at table; but hee riſeth from table, and girdeth himſelf to ſerve his loving gueſts at his table, Joh. 13.4. till 17. Wherby hee not only doth teach them an example of humilitie one to another, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over through them hee maketh good to all his Faithfull ſervants that promiſe which ſhall be fulfilled in his Kingdome, as hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it in Luke 12.37. <hi>Bleſſed are the ſervants whom the Lord when hee commeth ſhall find watching</hi> (and conſequently faithfull to him in their charges) <hi>verily I ſaye unto yow that hee ſhall gird himſelf and make them ſitte downe to meat, and will come forth and ſerve them.</hi> This then Chriſt having done at his laſt Supper to his Diſciples; and promiſed to doe to all that ſhould bee watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, may bee conceived to have beene ſome part of his intention in the ſealing of his covenant to all beleevers. See alſo for this Luke 22.27.</p>
            <p n="12">12. From all which this Concluſion as a Generall Rule is to bee gathered, namely:</p>
            <p>That that Manner of Adminiſtration of the Lords Supper is moſt warrantable which commeth neereſt unto this Practiſe of
<pb facs="tcp:151076:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Chriſt: which doth expreſſe and repreſent moſt effectually this his whole intention; &amp; which is fitteſt to accompliſh moſt fully his commandement of celebrating the Memoriall of his death till his comming againe; and of the benefits &amp; bleſſednes which the Faithfull reap both by the one and the other.</p>
            <p>And that on the other ſide that manner which is furtheſt off from Chriſts practiſe, which doth leaſt repreſent and expreſſe his intention, and which is leaſt fitte to accompliſh his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of celebrating the Memoriall of his death, till his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming againe; is leaſt warrantable, and ought not to bee practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed when it can bee omitted, without the ſcandale of a rent in the Churches.</p>
            <p>Now it is evident that a table geſture commeth ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ereſt unto Chriſts Practiſe, and doth expreſſe beſt his whole intention, and is fitteſt to fulfill his commandement, and that on the other ſide, that geſture which is furtheſt from a table geſture is leaſt fitted for all theſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore it followeth that a table geſture is moſt warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that which is furtheſt from a table geſture, is leaſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable to bee uſed in the Adminiſtration of the LORDS Supper.</p>
